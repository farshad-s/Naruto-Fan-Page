# Introduction

I created a Naruto Fan Page using HTML, SCSS, and Vanilla JS.
I have also used Bootstrap for styling.

## Website Pages

### Home Page

I have gone with a minimal display to keep it simple

### Characters

In Progress

### Trivia

I have created a small quiz based on Naruto.

Click on the start button to start, choose your answer, and click next question to move to the next question.

If you click next question without answering, it will be considered as skipping the question.

If you get 3 or more questions right, you pass, else you fail!

Play till the end and see if you are a real Naruto Fan
